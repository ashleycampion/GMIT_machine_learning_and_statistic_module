    "#### Task 1 - October 5th, 2020 \n",
    "Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. Your code should not depend on any module from the standard library or otherwise. You should research the task first and include references and a description of your algorithm.\n",
    "#### Research\n",
    "Newton's method [1] can be used to iteratively approach closer toware the square root of a number. According to Newton's method, one can approach further toward the square root of a number, x, from an initial guess of the square root, z, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z_{next} = z - \\frac{z^2-x}{2z} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two impediments to achieving a precision to 100 decimal places without using any Python modules, however:\n",
    "1. Decimal point numbers do not have exact representations in binary floating point, i.e. in Python's float datatype, which is the only datatype available for displaying decimal numbers in Python without the use of modules such as Decimal [2]. This means that we will not likely be able to achieve the accuracy required to display the square root of two to 100 decimal places, as in order to do so we would have to perform many very precise calculations involving floating point numbers, which are by definition imprecise.\n",
    "2. Calculating to 100 decimal places is computationally expensive and is not feasible on standard laptops with limited RAM and CPU cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "What will thus been shown as part of my solution is as follows:\n",
    "1. Python's Math module's sqrt function is not accurate to the 100th decimal place (we will use NASA calculation of the root of 2 to ~ million decimal places as our comparison [3]), nor is it able to provide a 100 decimal places. From this we can infer that the inaccuracy resides in teh datatype used by this function, namely, the float.\n",
    "2. Python's Decimal module's sqrt function is accurate to 100 decimal places, again indicating that Python's float datatype is what is at issue above.\n",
    "3. The computational expense of calculating a square root using only in-built functions (i.e. no imported functions) increases significantly when the difference between the actual root squared and the calculated root squared is less than .0001.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conclusion from this is that to calculate the square root of 2 in Python one must import a module, e.g. the Decimal module.\n",
